<h4>Background</h4>

<hr/>

<p>I come from a strong interdisciplinary background interfacing Environmental Planning, Geoinformatics, Environmental Epidemiology and Climate. Growing up in Bangladesh, I encountered many environmental problems but I focused on a particular one for my thesis to complete my B.Sc. in Urban and Regional Planning from <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/" target="_blank">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</a>. The leather manufacturing industries in the Hazaribagh Tannery area of the capital Dhaka extensively polluted the surrounding environment and the main river Buriganga leaving notorious health effects for thousands of people but several attempts by Bangladesh government to relocate these industries failed. I asked why? The answer was my <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0975425313477749" target="_blank">first scientific paper</a>. Soon I  realized that some scientific tools like, what is popularly known as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), are incredibly helpful to find such answers. I came to Europe with an Erasmus Mundus scholarship to study for an <a href="http://mastergeotech.info" target="_blank">M.Sc. in Geospatial Technologies</a> and it blew my mind. What I used to know as a system (GIS) turned out to be a Science of spatiotemporally explicit phenomena!</p>

<p>The study of GIScience helped me understand how things are spatially related, distributed and globally connected, and soon I discovered the global problem that has been instigating and exacerbating many other local problems, Global Warming. Ph.D. in Spatial Environmental Health from the University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany.</p>

<h4>Research</h4>

<hr/>

<p>My current research focuses on social tipping points for climate mitigation and sustainability transformation. I explore innovative and existing climate solutions, and study how they could be implemented to exponentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and abruptly transform societies to sustainability. I also models the successful implementation pathways for UN Sustainable Development Goals. I am an author of the first Exponential Climate Action Roadmap Report released in the Global Climate Action Summit 2018. I am also an author of the first World in 2050 Report released in the UN High Level Political Forum in 2018. </p>
