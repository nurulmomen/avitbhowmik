	abstract = {Mining for resources extraction may lead to geological and associated environmental changes due to ground movements, collision with mining cavities, and deformation of aquifers. Geological changes may continue in a reclaimed mine area, and the deformed aquifers may entail a breakdown of substrates and an increase in ground water tables, which may cause surface area inundation. Consequently, a reclaimed mine area may experience surface area collapse, i.e., subsidence, and degradation of vegetation productivity. Thus, monitoring short-term landscape dynamics in a reclaimed mine area may provide important information on the long-term geological and environmental impacts of mining activities. We studied landscape dynamics in Kirchheller Heide, Germany, which experienced extensive soil movement due to longwall mining without stowing, using Landsat imageries between 2013 and 2016. A Random Forest image classification technique was applied to analyze land-use and landcover dynamics, and the growth of wetland areas was assessed using a Spectral Mixture Analysis ({SMA}). We also analyzed the changes in vegetation productivity using a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}). We observed a 19.9\% growth of wetland area within four years, with 87.2\% growth in the coverage of two major waterbodies in the reclaimed mine area. {NDVI} values indicate that the productivity of 66.5\% of vegetation of the Kirchheller Heide was degraded due to changes in ground water tables and surface flooding. Our results inform environmental management and mining reclamation authorities about the subsidence spots and priority mitigation areas from land surface and vegetation degradation in Kirchheller Heide.},

Results prove the strong unwillingness of leather industries’ owners to relocate and pay for relocation, failure at imposing Pigovian tax and the high hedonic prices of the houses including threats to inhabitants’ health in the redeveloped residential area. In addition to high subsidy and compensation, historic growth trends and potential risks of flood and surface water resource pollution of Dhaka defy sustainability issues. Considering three consecutive failures to meet the relocation deadlines, these results claim that redeveloping an environment friendly leather processing zone at the present location will ensure sustainable urban development.},

	abstract = {The Sundarbans is the largest single block of tidal halophytic mangrove forest in the World. The versatile biodiversity of this forest, situated at the southwest of Bangladesh, plays a vital role in maintaining environmental sustainability of the country. This study identifies and quantifies the damage caused by the tropical cyclone Sidr in 15 November 2007 and the post-cyclone regeneration of the botanic biodiversity of the Sundarbans. Unsupervised classification and the normalised difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) were carried out over a temporal series of four Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus ({ETM} +) images for the month of February in the period between years 2007 and 2010. The obtained overall accuracies for the classification of the images of years 2007 and 2010 (the ones' for which there were ground-truth data available) were, respectively, 76\% and 88\%. Classification results and land change analysis show that three important botanic species - Heritiera fomes (Sundari), Excoecaria agallocha (Gewa) and Sonneratia mangrove (Kewra) have been significantly affected by the cyclone. On the other hand {NDVI} analysis indicated that 45\% area of the Sundarbans (approximately 2500 sq.km) has been damaged due to the cyclone action. Results further indicate that the rate of post-cyclone regeneration in 2009-2010 is four times higher than the regeneration rate of 2008-2009. Although cyclone Sidr has done significant damage to the diversity of the mangrove forest, it has regenerated to a satisfactory condition despite the effects of climate change and man-made encroachment.},

The extraction of stream networks from digital elevation models ({DEMs}) and delineation of upstream riparian corridors ({URCs}) for stream sampling points ({SSPs}) are frequently used techniques in freshwater and environmental research. Selection of an accumulation threshold ({AT}) for stream extraction and delineation of {URCs} are often done manually. Two algorithms are introduced in this paper that allow for automated {AT} selection and {URC} delineation. {ATs} are selected to yield the highest overlap of {DEM}-derived and traditionally mapped streams as well as to assure extraction of all mapped streams from {DEMs}. {URCs} are delineated after snapping {SSPs} to {DEM}-derived streams. The new tool showed similar or better performance than comparable algorithms and is freely available, interfacing the open source software packages R and {GRASS} {GIS}. It will improve the extraction of stream networks and the assessment of magnitude and scale of effects from riparian stressors (e.g. landuse) on freshwater ecosystems.},

	shorttitle = {Environmental Sustainability vs. Political Decision},
	abstract = {Over the past four decades, the leather processing activity migrated from developed to developing countries. This led to the uncontrolled and unplanned development of leather processing industries in the environmentally-stressed developing countries, such as Bangladesh. Although these industries are very important for the flourishing export oriented economy of the country, lack of basic environmental protection measures have been entailing serious threats to the environmental sustainability. In response, a relocation project was launched by the Bangladesh government for the industries in Hazaribag - the principle leather processing zone located in the capital Dhaka. The project planned the relocation of these industries to an upstream and outskirt location – Savar, with the target of mitigating the environmental pollution and ecological hazard. This paper reviewed the relocation project plan from the environmental economics and urban planning point of views. The concepts and methods applied for the review are the 'Willingness to Pay', 'Concept of Pigovian fees', 'Hedonic Pricing Method' and 'Social theory of Cities'. The results prove that the project's target of ensuring environmental sustainability will go in vain because launching and executing this project was merely a political decision, which did not take into account any of the scientific arguments. 82\% of the surveyed leather industry owners is neither willing to move to the proposed location nor willing to pay for the relocation and effluent treatment sanctioning at the new location. 18\% is willing to move under the conditions of subsidies, compensations and government provided effluent treatment facilities. The Bangladesh government has to pay {BDT} 5.93 billion as compensation and subsidy in addition to the actual project cost of {BDT} 5.45 billion, whereas the expense is only {BDT} 3.57 billion for redeveloping Hazaribag as a planned, controlled leather industry estate in the present location with adequate environmental protection measures. The proposed transformation plan of Hazaribag brown field to a residential area after industries' relocation, poses further threats to the human health. The upstream location of Savar risks the pollution of the entire surface water sources of Dhaka. Finally, the argument of relocating the leather industries to an outskirt location proves to be invalid in light of the historic growth trend of Dhaka. Considering the three consecutive failures to meet the relocation deadlines, these results claim that rather the redevelopment of Hazaribag industries in the present location by providing the environment friendly leather processing equipments will ensure environmental sustainability of the city.},

In this paper, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variability of the yearly maximum temperature ({TXx}), which characterizes the summer in Bangladesh, sampled at 34 meteorological stations during 1948-2007. We identified monotonic and robust temporal trends of {TXx} by each station and examined the spatial pattern of {TXx} from interpolated surfaces in each year. We quantified the variability of {TXx} over space and time and indentified temporal trends in the regional mean and interpolated {TXx}. In contrast to the existing studies, our results depicted an overall decreasing trend in the regional {TXx}. A regional shift of the summer was observed due to the decreasing and increasing {TXx} in the warmer northern and the cooler southern regions, respectively. We discussed the relevance of our findings to the future climate change impacts on this region.},

A statistical assessment based on univariate statistics of the resulting continuous surfaces indicates that there is little difference in the predictive power of these techniques making hard the decision of selecting the best interpolation method. A Willmott statistical evaluation has been applied to minimize this uncertainty. Results show that {IDW} performs better for average and minimum temperature trends and Ordinary Kriging for maximum temperature trends. Results further indicate that temperature has an increasing trend all over Bangladesh noticably in the northern and coastal southern parts of the country. The temperature follows an overall increasing trend of 1.06 o C per 100 years.},

	abstract = {Abstract Given the multitude of pesticides used in agriculture, adjacent streams are typically exposed to pesticide mixtures. Previous studies analysed the ecological risks of a few pesticide mixtures or were limited to an individual region or crop, whereas a large scale analysis of pesticide mixtures is missing. We analysed routine monitoring data from Germany, France, the Netherlands and the \{{USA}\} comprising a total of 4532 sites and 56,084 sampling occasions with the aim to identify the most frequently detected pesticides, their metabolites and mixtures. The most frequently detected compounds were dominated by herbicides and their metabolites. Mixtures mostly comprised of two up to five compounds, whereas mixtures in the \{{USA}\} and France had clearly less compounds than those of Germany and the Netherlands. The number of detected pesticides and thereby the size of mixtures is positively correlated to the number of measured pesticides (r = 0.57). In contrast, a low relationship was found to the ratio of agricultural areas within the catchment (r = 0.17), and no relationship was found to the size of the catchment (r = 0.06). Overall, our study provides priority mixtures for different countries that may be used for future ecotoxicological studies to improve risk assessment for stream ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The Columbia Climate Center, in partnership with World Wildlife Fund, Woods Hole Research Center, and Arctic 21, held a workshop titled A 5 ̊C Arctic in a 2 ̊C World on July 20 and 21, 2016. The workshop was co-sponsored by the International Arctic Research Center (University of Alaska Fairbanks), the Arctic Institute of North America (Canada), the {MEOPAR} Network (Marine Environmental Observation, Prediction, and Response), and the Future Ocean Excellence Cluster. The goal of the workshop was to advance thinking on the science and policy implications of the temperature change in the context of the 1.5 to {\textless}2 ̊C warming expected for the globe, as dis- cussed during the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at Paris in 2015. For the Arctic, such an increase means an antic- ipated increase of roughly 3.5 to 5 ̊C. An international group of 41 experts shared perspectives on the regional and global impacts of an up to +5 ̊C Arctic, examined the feasibility of actively lowering Arctic temperatures, and considered realistic timescales associated with such interven- tions. The group also discussed the science and the political and governance actions required for alternative Arctic futures.},

	abstract = {The 194 signatories to the Paris Agreement range in size from small island nations (Tuvalu, less than 10,000 people) to massive states (India and China, which between them have 2.6 billion people). Their cultural backgrounds, political, economic and social systems vary widely. What they all share is an agreement for climate stabilisation at 1.5-2 ̊C. A roadmap outlining potential exponential transitions towards a carbon-free economy may benefit from a logarithmic “powers of ten” framework that sets aside backgrounds and systems to examine the relative population concentration scales–from the individual (100) to local/neighborhood (103) to the national/transnational scales (108) and ultimately the global population of around 10 billion anticipated in 2050 (1010). What are the related targets and indicators for successful engagement at each level for rapid and radical reductions of carbon emissions and concentrations? What are the possible interventions and barriers that may be applied at different levels of population concentration? What “drawdown” strategies are most appropriate for different scales? Could focusing demonstrations of clean energy and sustainable practices on the local/neighborhood to urban scale (103- 104) provide a leverage that has not been achieved at more complex national and transnational scales? Ultimately, backgrounds and systems are important factors in the equation, but the “powers of 10” scaling framework may provide a compass to assist in identifying the challenges, opportunities and related thresholds and tipping points for achieving deep decarbonization and transformation of the global energy infrastructure at every level of society over the next thirty-three years.},
