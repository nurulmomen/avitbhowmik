A range of technologies — loosely defined as 'geoengineering' — are being explored as responses to climate change. Yet their effectiveness, and whether they should be implemented at all, is debated among scientists. Read my interview with [Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/geoengineering-climate-change-projects/a-52117714?maca=en-Facebook-sharing&fbclid=IwAR0wjxEVwZ7Zx84dlsIqTPzfbaKIUS2k3RBYk86RTUx17LOdRE3l1Mp0_yg).
