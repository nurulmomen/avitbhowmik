In a recent talk at Karlstad University, I outlined the climate challenge that humanity is facing and how Exponential Climate Action Roadmap initiative tackles this. 36 solutions with their exponential implementation strategies can halve global emission by 2030. I also shared my experience of participating at the Global Climate Week and UN Climate Action Summit as an Environmental Scientist, Solution Modeller and Climate Striker!
