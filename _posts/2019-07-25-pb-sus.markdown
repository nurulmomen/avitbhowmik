If you are a Vogtian (William Vogt laid the foundation of "Environmental Carrying Capacity" in his famous and important book "Road to Survival"), you know how crucial it is to respect and not to transgress Environmental Carrying Capacity. The Planetary Boundaries concept is a modernist revolution of the carrying capacity, a concept coined by Johan Rockström and his colleagues in 2009. Since the foundation, the planetary boundaries concept has gained a huge impact across science and policy shaping the first Science Based Targets for achieving sustainability and a safe operating space of humanity. Ten years after the original publication of the concept, my colleagues amd I made an in-depth analysis of academic research and discussion generated by the concept. Read [here](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2019-07-25-its-all-about-the-safe-operating-space.html) what we found out.
