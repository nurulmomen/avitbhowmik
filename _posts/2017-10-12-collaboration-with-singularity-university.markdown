Every year, participants from a wide diversity of backgrounds, geographies, perspectives and expertise gather in the NASA Research Park in Mountain View, Silicon Valley for a 10-week immersive hands-on experience. Hosted by the Global Solutions Program at Singularity University, the participants are introduced to the world of exponential technologies in their quest to solve the worldâ€™s greatest challenges.

I joined this year's Global Solutions Programs with an amazing team from Stockholm Resilience Centre and led a discussion on the risks associate with the Anthropocene, particularly how global environmental changes are triggering and amplifying conflicts, migrations and epidemic diseases. Offering a range of solutions and technologies to mitigate climate problems, I introduced a framework for scaling transformations and climate solutions.
