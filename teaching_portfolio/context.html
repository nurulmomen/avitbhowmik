I have joined as an Assistant Professor of Risk and Environmental Studies at Karlstad University in March 2019. I have been teaching Geographic Information System, Environmental Risks, Climate Change and Sustainability related courses at German and Swedish universities since 2012. I have already obtained formal pedagogical training from the “Higher Education Teaching Centre” of University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany in 2013. I have also completed the supervision of five master’s and diploma theses, and one Ph.D. thesis, and currently supervising one Ph.D. thesis. I am one of the core organisers of  four summer schools on “Spatial Ecotoxicology” supported by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and one workshop on “Spatial Ecology” in the 9th Symposium for European Freshwater Sciences (SEFS).

My teaching philosophy is "problem-based learning". I encourage students to understand and analyse the problem in depth before delving into solutions. I design my teaching activities relying on Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO), but also with a focus on developing critical thinking among students. I try to update my teaching practice and content according to modern theories of teaching in higher education and follow up-to-date pedagogic literature for the purpose. My teaching activities promote course materials, exercises, and focus on continuous feedback and enabling communication and cooperation among course participants. In essence, now I am in between a lecturer and facilitator in my classrooms but aim to become a complete facilitator in my teaching career.
