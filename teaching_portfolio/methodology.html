<h4>A pedagogical strategy</h4>

<hr/>

<p>

I aim to design a constructive alignment for the course in this portfolio that will deliver ability of climate action among the students. I intend to develop a <em>pedagogical strategy</em>  that will include students' ability at the core of the design and plan. The strategy, as you see in the figure below, will include a revised set of Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO) and examination criteria, an extended profile of learners and organisational setup, which will be combined in a systematic flow to produce the aimed pedagogical strategy.

<h4>Resources and difficulties</h4>

<hr/>

<p>
The core persons to help in these process are the experienced sustainability and climate teachers, primarily in Karlstad University but also in other universities around the world. Their view on how to materialize a course to enable climate action among students would be valuable. Environmental educators are the primary experts in this field and can provide valuable input. Experts in the climate mitigation field and my own research can provide knowledge on what needed and demanded in the practical world. The director of studies on my discipline can help putting this effort into the organisational context.
</p>

<p>
The inherently difficult part of the whole activity is to identify and apply proper ILO, teaching activities and assessments method that deliver and evaluate students' ability on climate action. When ability may refer to intellectual ability of analysing, explaining, interpreting and communicating climate action, which almost all students in the previous session acquired, the target of this portfolio is to provide the hands-on ability in the field. As a scientist and non-practitioner, it will be likely difficult for me to conceptualize and design a proper strategy. I plan to overcome this through consultations with experienced environmental educators and practitioners, and comparing my strategy with other strategies (if available) successful in providing action.
</p>

<p>
One crucial aspect of the whole process is the design of the excursions, which are a strong manner of involving the students in hands-on activities.
</p>

<p>
I expect continuous guidance and feedback from the course leader during the strategy development process. Formal knowledge on the procedure of developing constructive alignment would be useful, which I could also potentially apply in other courses. Input from participants from disciplines dealing with practical education, e.g. engineering, on how they interface classroom and practical field would be valuable.
