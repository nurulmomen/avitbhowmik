<p>
I have joined as an Assistant Professor of Risk and Environmental Studies at Karlstad University in March 2019. My teaching career started in Germany in 2012, when I joined University of Münster as an academic tutor. I mostly teach Climate Change and Sustainability, Environmental Risks and Geographic Information Systems and related courses. Since 2012, I have delivered more than 100 lectures and seminars at four German and Swedish universities. I have already obtained formal pedagogical training from the “Higher Education Teaching Centre” of University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany in 2013. Meanwhile, I have also completed the supervision of five master’s and diploma, and one Ph.D. theses, and currently (co)supervising one Ph.D. thesis.

I have also taught and instructed in several international programs and workshops. I am one of the core organizers of four summer schools on “Spatial Ecotoxicology” supported by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). I have instructed in the “Spatial Ecology” workshop at the 9th Symposium for European Freshwater Sciences (SEFS). I lectured as a sustainability expert at the <a href="https://su.org/press-room/press-releases/singularity-university-completes-2017-global-solutions-program/">Global Solutions Program</a>, organized by Google Inc. in the NASA Research Park, San Francisco, USA in 2017.

My teaching philosophy is "problem-based learning". I encourage students to understand and analyse the problem in depth before delving into solutions. I design my teaching activities relying on Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO), but also with a focus on developing critical thinking among students. I try to update my teaching practice and content according to modern theories of teaching in higher education and follow up-to-date pedagogic literature for the purpose. My teaching activities promote course materials, exercises, and focus on continuous feedback and enabling communication and cooperation among course participants. In essence, now I am in between a lecturer and facilitator in my classrooms but aim to become a complete facilitator in my teaching career.
