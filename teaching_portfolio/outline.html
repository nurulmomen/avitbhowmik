<h4>Problem statement</h4>

<hr/>

<p>
As a working case for this portfolio, I select the course <a href="https://www.kau.se/en/education/programmes-and-courses/courses/CCGA08" target="_blank">Nordic Climate Change Studies (CCGA08)</a>. I taught this course for the first time during the autumn semester of 2019. The course is mainly designed for the exchange students from Lüneburg University, Germany but I received students from all over the world including students from other study programs at Karlstad University. The age group of the students is around 25 years and their level of current education ranged from bachelor's to master's.
</p>

<p>

The problem I would like to address in this portfolio regarding the CCGA08 course is:

</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The learning outcomes don't deliver ability</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

I had a great set of collaborative students in the classroom, who engaged into intriguing discussion and brought in novel input to the final essay as a fulfillment of the course. However, during the presentation of the essay, when I asked them: "How would you apply what you learned in this course to transform your peers into sustainability and mitigate climate change in your context?", there was no satisfactory answer. This shows me something along the process went terribly long. With my six years' experience of working in the climate change and climate mitigation field, I realized that the absolute urgent thing needed is individual climate action. I designed this course with the liberty I was given to deliver this ability among the students. I included output of my own research work and continuously emphasized the need for climate action. However, although students' knowledge of climate change and mitigation substantially improved after the course, the ability to act was absent.  
</p>


<p></p>

<h4>Aim: a pedagogical strategy</h4>

<hr/>

<p>

I aim to design a constructive alignment for the course in this portfolio that will deliver ability of climate action among the students. I intend to develop a <em>pedagogical strategy</em>  that will include students' ability at the core of the design and plan. The strategy, as you see in the figure below, will include a revised set of Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO) and examination criteria, an extended profile of learners and organisational setup, which will be combined in a systematic flow to produce the aimed pedagogical strategy.

<h4>Resources and difficulties</h4>

<hr/>

<p>
The core persons to help in these process are the experienced sustainability and climate teachers, primarily in Karlstad University but also in other universities around the world. Their view on how to materialize a course to enable climate action among students would be valuable. Environmental educators are the primary experts in this field and can provide valuable input. Experts in the climate mitigation field and my own research can provide knowledge on what needed and demanded in the practical world. The director of studies on my discipline can help putting this effort into the organisational context.
</p>

<p>
The inherently difficult part of the whole activity is to identify and apply proper ILO, teaching activities and assessments method that deliver and evaluate students' ability on climate action. When ability may refer to intellectual ability of analysing, explaining, interpreting and communicating climate action, which almost all students in the previous session acquired, the target of this portfolio is to provide the hands-on ability in the field. As a scientist and non-practitioner, it will be likely difficult for me to conceptualize and design a proper strategy. I plan to overcome this through consultations with experienced environmental educators and practitioners, and comparing my strategy with other strategies (if available) successful in providing action.
</p>

<p>
One crucial aspect of the whole process is the design of the excursions, which are a strong manner of involving the students in hands-on activities.
</p>

<p>
I expect continuous guidance and feedback from the course leader during the strategy development process. Formal knowledge on the procedure of developing constructive alignment would be useful, which I could also potentially apply in other courses. Input from participants from disciplines dealing with practical education, e.g. engineering, on how they interface classroom and practical field would be valuable.
