<h4>Research</h4>

<p>Draw a first plan for your course work (to put together a pedagogical portfolio).

Try to include the following:

What is the course and what is the problem in that course you intend to work with?
What kind of things (documents, etc.) will you need to include in your portfolio?
Describe the work that will be required to produce this material. 
Can you see blocks or sequences of work.
Who can help/must be consulted?
What parts of the work will be particulary difficult? Why?
How can the difficulties be managed practically?
What kind of help will you probably need from the course leader/other participants?

Note that a first plan do not need to be particularly precise or quantified or detailed. The purpose is only to try to draft an overall picture of the course project you are about to do. Do not be afraid to be concrete, it helps you to see what will be important and what are the main difficulties.

And you may very well change your mind several times during the work. The purpose with this course assignment of submitting a draft plan is to get you going with the work and to give the course leader a chance to give you formative feedback at an early stage.</p>
