<h4>Background</h4>

<p>I come from a strong interdisciplinary background interfacing Environmental Health, Planning and Geoinformatics. I grew up in Bangladesh, where I also completed my B.Sc. in <a href="http://urp.buet.ac.bd" target="_blank">Urban and Regional Planning</a> from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. I obtained a joint universities M.Sc. in Geospatial Technology from the European Union supported Erasmus Mundus program and a Ph.D. in Spatial Environmental Health from the University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany.</p>

<h4>Research</h4>

<p>My current research focuses on social tipping points for climate mitigation and sustainability transformation. I explore innovative and existing climate solutions, and study how they could be implemented to exponentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and abruptly transform societies to sustainability. I also models the successful implementation pathways for UN Sustainable Development Goals. I am an author of the first Exponential Climate Action Roadmap Report released in the Global Climate Action Summit 2018. I am also an author of the first World in 2050 Report released in the UN High Level Political Forum in 2018. </p>
