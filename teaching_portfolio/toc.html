<p>

This teaching portfolio for Avit K. Bhowmik is being developed to fulfill the requirements of Teaching in Higher Education 2 (AUPU2) course at Karlstad University, Sweden. Below is a preliminary brief outline of the portfolio constituting sections that will be continuously elaborated.

</p>

<p></p>

<h4>Teaching context</h4>

<hr/>

<p>

I have joined as an Assistant Professor of Risk and Environmental Studies at Karlstad University in March 2019. I have been teaching Geographic Information System, Environmental Risks, Climate Change and Sustainability related courses at German and Swedish universities since 2012. I have already obtained formal pedagogical training from the “Higher Education Teaching Centre” of University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany in 2013. I have also completed the supervision of five master’s and diploma theses, and one Ph.D. thesis, and currently supervising one Ph.D. thesis. I am one of the core organisers of  four summer schools on “Spatial Ecotoxicology” supported by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and one workshop on “Spatial Ecology” in the 9th Symposium for European Freshwater Sciences (SEFS).

</p>

<p>

My teaching philosophy is "problem-based learning". I encourage students to understand and analyse the problem in depth before delving into solutions. I design my teaching activities relying on Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO), but also with a focus on developing critical thinking among students. I try to update my teaching practice and content according to modern theories of teaching in higher education and follow up-to-date pedagogic literature for the purpose. My teaching activities promote course materials, exercises, and focus on continuous feedback and enabling communication and cooperation among course participants. In essence, now I am in between a lecturer and facilitator in my classrooms but aim to become a complete facilitator in my teaching career.

<h4>Problem statement</h4>

<hr/>

<p>
As a working case for this portfolio, I select the course <a href="https://www.kau.se/en/education/programmes-and-courses/courses/CCGA08" target="_blank">Nordic Climate Change Studies (CCGA08)</a>. I taught this course for the first time during the autumn semester of 2019. The course is mainly designed for the exchange students from Lüneburg University, Germany but I received students from all over the world including students from other study programs at Karlstad University. The age group of the students is around 25 years and their level of current education ranged from bachelor's to master's.
</p>

<p>

The problem I would like to address in this portfolio regarding the CCGA08 course is:

</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The learning outcomes don't deliver ability</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

I had a great set of collaborative students in the classroom, who engaged into intriguing discussion and brought in novel input to the final essay as a fulfillment of the course. However, during the presentation of the essay, when I asked them: "How would you apply what you learned in this course to transform your peers into sustainability and mitigate climate change in your context?", there was no satisfactory answer. This shows me something along the process went terribly long. With my six years' experience of working in the climate change and climate mitigation field, I realized that the absolute urgent thing needed is individual climate action. I designed this course with the liberty I was given to deliver this ability among the students. I included output of my own research work and continuously emphasized the need for climate action. However, although students' knowledge of climate change and mitigation substantially improved after the course, the ability to act was absent.

<h4>Aim: a pedagogical strategy</h4>

<hr/>

<p>

I aim to design a constructive alignment for the course in this portfolio that will deliver ability of climate action among the students. I intend to develop a <em>pedagogical strategy</em>  that will include students' ability at the core of the design and plan. The strategy, as you see in the figure below, will include a revised set of Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO) and examination criteria, an extended profile of learners and organisational setup, which will be combined in a systematic flow to produce the aimed pedagogical strategy.

<h4>Resources and difficulties</h4>

<hr/>

<p>

</p>

<h4>Research</h4>

<p>Draw a first plan for your course work (to put together a pedagogical portfolio).

Try to include the following:

Who can help/must be consulted?
What parts of the work will be particulary difficult? Why?
How can the difficulties be managed practically?
What kind of help will you probably need from the course leader/other participants?

Note that a first plan do not need to be particularly precise or quantified or detailed. The purpose is only to try to draft an overall picture of the course project you are about to do. Do not be afraid to be concrete, it helps you to see what will be important and what are the main difficulties.

And you may very well change your mind several times during the work. The purpose with this course assignment of submitting a draft plan is to get you going with the work and to give the course leader a chance to give you formative feedback at an early stage.</p>
