This teaching portfolio for Avit K. Bhowmik is being developed to fulfill the requirements of Teaching in Higher Education 2 (AUPU2) course at Karlstad University, Sweden. Below is a preliminary brief outline of the portfolio constituting sections that will be continuously elaborated.

<h4>Teaching context</h4>

<hr/>

<p>

I have joined as an Assistant Professor of Risk and Environmental Studies at Karlstad University in March 2019. I have been teaching Geographic Information System, Environmental Risks, Climate Change and Sustainability related courses at German and Swedish universities since 2012. I have already obtained formal pedagogical training from the “Higher Education Teaching Centre” of University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany in 2013. I have also completed the supervision of five master’s and diploma theses, and one Ph.D. thesis, and currently supervising one Ph.D. thesis. I am one of the core organisers of  four summer schools on “Spatial Ecotoxicology” supported by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and one workshop on “Spatial Ecology” in the 9th Symposium for European Freshwater Sciences (SEFS).

<p>

My teaching philosophy is "problem-based learning". I encourage students to understand and analyse the problem in depth before delving into solutions. I design my teaching activities relying on Intended Learning Outcomes (ILO), but also with a focus on developing critical thinking among students. I try to update my teaching practice and content according to modern theories of teaching in higher education and follow up-to-date pedagogic literature for the purpose. My teaching activities promote course materials, exercises, and focus on continuous feedback and enabling communication and cooperation among course participants. In essence, now I am in between a lecturer and facilitator in my classrooms but aim to become a complete facilitator in my teaching career.

<h4>Research</h4>

<p>Draw a first plan for your course work (to put together a pedagogical portfolio).

Try to include the following:

What is the course and what is the problem in that course you intend to work with?
What kind of things (documents, etc.) will you need to include in your portfolio?
Describe the work that will be required to produce this material. 
Can you see blocks or sequences of work.
Who can help/must be consulted?
What parts of the work will be particulary difficult? Why?
How can the difficulties be managed practically?
What kind of help will you probably need from the course leader/other participants?

Note that a first plan do not need to be particularly precise or quantified or detailed. The purpose is only to try to draft an overall picture of the course project you are about to do. Do not be afraid to be concrete, it helps you to see what will be important and what are the main difficulties.

And you may very well change your mind several times during the work. The purpose with this course assignment of submitting a draft plan is to get you going with the work and to give the course leader a chance to give you formative feedback at an early stage.</p>
