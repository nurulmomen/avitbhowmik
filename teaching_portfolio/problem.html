<h4>Problem statement</h4>

<hr/>

<p>

The problem I would like to address in this portfolio regarding the CCGA08 course is:

</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The learning outcomes don't deliver ability</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

I had a great set of collaborative students in the classroom, who engaged into intriguing discussion and brought in novel input to the final essay as a fulfillment of the course. However, during the presentation of the essay, when I asked them: "How would you apply what you learned in this course to transform your peers into sustainability and mitigate climate change in your context?", there was no satisfactory answer. This shows me something along the process went terribly long. With my six years' experience of working in the climate change and climate mitigation field, I realized that the absolute urgent thing needed is individual climate action. I designed this course with the liberty I was given to deliver this ability among the students. I included output of my own research work and continuously emphasized the need for climate action. However, although students' knowledge of climate change and mitigation substantially improved after the course, the ability to act was absent.
