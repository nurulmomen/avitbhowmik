Need to update.

</p>

<ul>
<li>Course setup</li>
<hr/>
<p>
As a working case for this portfolio, I select the course <a href="https://www.kau.se/en/education/programmes-and-courses/courses/CCGA08" target="_blank">Nordic Climate Change Studies (CCGA08)</a>. I taught this course for the first time during the autumn semester of 2019.
</p>
<li>Learners' profile</li>
<p>
The course is mainly designed for the exchange students from LÃ¼neburg University, Germany but I received students from all over the world including students from other study programs at Karlstad University. The age group of the students is around 25 years and their level of current education ranged from bachelor's to master's.
